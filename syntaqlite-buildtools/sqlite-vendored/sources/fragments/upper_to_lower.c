/* All of the upper-to-lower conversion data is above.  The following
** 18 integers are completely unrelated.  They are appended to the
** sqlite3UpperToLower[] array to avoid UBSAN warnings.  Here's what is
** going on:
**
** The SQL comparison operators (<>, =, >, <=, <, and >=) are implemented
** by invoking sqlite3MemCompare(A,B) which compares values A and B and
** returns negative, zero, or positive if A is less then, equal to, or
** greater than B, respectively.  Then the true false results is found by
** consulting sqlite3aLTb[opcode], sqlite3aEQb[opcode], or 
** sqlite3aGTb[opcode] depending on whether the result of compare(A,B)
** is negative, zero, or positive, where opcode is the specific opcode.
** The only works because the comparison opcodes are consecutive and in
** this order: NE EQ GT LE LT GE.  Various assert()s throughout the code
** ensure that is the case.
**
** These elements must be appended to another array.  Otherwise the
** index (here shown as [256-OP_Ne]) would be out-of-bounds and thus
** be undefined behavior.  That's goofy, but the C-standards people thought
** it was a good idea, so here we are.

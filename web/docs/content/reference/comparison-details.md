SQLite SQL tooling landscape.


# Parser Comparison

Per-statement SQLite SQL parsing accuracy, validated against sqlite3 as ground truth.

## Ground Truth

Validating all test statements against sqlite3:

## Parser Accuracy

Legend: **PASS** = correctly parses valid SQL, **FAIL** = rejects valid SQL, **FP** = accepts invalid SQL

## Round-Trip Validation

For each formatter: does the formatted output still pass real SQLite?

# Validator Comparison

Error detection accuracy and diagnostic quality.

## Diagnostic Quality

A realistic query with subtle errors — how does each tool report them?

**Query** (2 errors: CTE declares 3 columns but SELECT produces 2; typo `ROUDN`):

```sql
WITH
  monthly_stats(month, revenue, order_count) AS (
    SELECT
      STRFTIME('%Y-%m', o.created_at) AS month,
      SUM(o.total) AS revenue
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.status = 'completed'
    GROUP BY STRFTIME('%Y-%m', o.created_at)
  )
SELECT
  ms.month,
  ms.revenue,
  ms.order_count,
  ROUDN(ms.revenue / ms.order_count, 2) AS avg_order
FROM monthly_stats ms
ORDER BY ms.month DESC
LIMIT 12;
```

### syntaqlite

Static semantic analysis — offline, no database needed. Finds **both** errors in one pass:

```
error: table 'monthly_stats' has 2 values for 3 columns
  --> /var/folders/rx/t6_rqmqx0f15l7kgp7yjhcbc0000gn/T/tmp1e4h0drf.sql:29:3

   |
41 |   ROUDN(ms.revenue / ms.order_count, 2) AS avg_order
   |   ^~~~~
   = help: did you mean 'round'?
```

### sqlite3

Runtime execution — stops at first error:

```
Error: in prepare, table monthly_stats has 2 values for 3 columns
```

### sqlite-runner-lsp

Runtime via LSP — wraps sqlite3, same single error:

```
(no diagnostics)
```

### sql-lint

Structural checks only:

```
/var/folders/rx/t6_rqmqx0f15l7kgp7yjhcbc0000gn/T/tmp_e4wvap3.sql:1 sql-lint was unable to lint the following query "WITH...
```

## Error Detection Accuracy

Schema: `users`, `orders`, `products`, `order_items`. Ground truth: sqlite3.

# LSP Comparison

Feature testing for SQLite-aware language servers.

## Tested Capabilities

Each server is started, sent a test file, and probed for completion, hover,
diagnostics, and formatting. Results are from actual LSP responses.

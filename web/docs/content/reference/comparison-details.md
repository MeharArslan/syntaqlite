# Comparison — detailed results

Per-statement breakdowns, reproduction instructions, and methodology for the
[competitive comparison](@/reference/comparison.md).

Generated on `arm64-darwin` with syntaqlite `0.1.0` on 2026-03-14.

---

# How to reproduce

```bash
# 1. Install all competitor tools (npm, cargo, brew, go, uv)
tools/run-comparison --setup

# 2. Run all comparisons and generate markdown
tools/run-comparison --all

# 3. Or run a single category
tools/run-comparison parser
tools/run-comparison formatter
tools/run-comparison validator
tools/run-comparison lsp
```

**Requirements:** macOS or Linux, with `npm`, `cargo`, `brew` (macOS),
`go`, `uv`, and `sqlite3` on PATH. The setup script installs:

| Tool | Source | Version pinning |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| syntaqlite | Built from this repo (`cargo build --release`) | Current HEAD |
| lemon-rs | `tests/comparison/parser/` (Cargo workspace) | Pinned in Cargo.lock |
| sqlparser-rs | `tests/comparison/parser/` (Cargo workspace) | Pinned in Cargo.lock |
| sql-parser-cst | `tests/comparison/package.json` (npm) | Pinned in package-lock |
| node-sql-parser | `tests/comparison/package.json` (npm) | Pinned in package-lock |
| sqlglot | `tests/comparison/pyproject.toml` (uv) | Pinned in uv.lock |
| sqlfluff | `tests/comparison/pyproject.toml` (uv) | Pinned in uv.lock |
| sql-formatter | npm global | Latest at install time |
| prettier + sql-parser-cst | npm + prettier plugin | Pinned in package-lock |
| sleek | `cargo install sleek` | Latest at install time |
| sqruff | `brew install sqruff` | Latest at install time |
| sql-lint | `tests/comparison/package.json` (npm) | Pinned in package-lock |
| sqls | `go install` | Latest at install time |
| sql-language-server | npm global | Latest at install time |
| hyperfine | `brew install hyperfine` | Latest at install time |

**Speed benchmarks** use [hyperfine](https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine) with
`--warmup 3` to fill filesystem caches. Each tool is invoked as a subprocess —
this measures end-to-end wall time including process startup, which is realistic
for CLI usage and editor integrations.

**Test statements** are in `tests/comparison/test_statements.sql` (40 statements)
and `tests/comparison/bench_statements.sql` (25 statements for speed benchmarks).
The accuracy suite uses deliberately tricky SQLite-specific syntax; the speed
suite uses representative real-world queries.

## Round-trip validation

For each formatter: does the formatted output produce identical `EXPLAIN`
bytecode to the original? This verifies semantic preservation, not just
syntactic validity. "CORRUPT" means the bytecode differs or `EXPLAIN` fails.

# Validator details

## Diagnostic quality showcase

A realistic query with 2 subtle errors — how does each tool report them?

**Query** (CTE declares 3 columns but SELECT produces 2; typo `ROUDN`):

```sql
WITH
  monthly_stats(month, revenue, order_count) AS (
    SELECT
      STRFTIME('%Y-%m', o.created_at) AS month,
      SUM(o.total) AS revenue
    FROM orders o
    WHERE o.status = 'completed'
    GROUP BY STRFTIME('%Y-%m', o.created_at)
  )
SELECT
  ms.month,
  ms.revenue,
  ms.order_count,
  ROUDN(ms.revenue / ms.order_count, 2) AS avg_order
FROM monthly_stats ms
ORDER BY ms.month DESC
LIMIT 12;
```

### syntaqlite

Static semantic analysis — offline, no database needed. Finds **both** errors in one pass:

```text

  --> /var/folders/rx/t6_rqmqx0f15l7kgp7yjhcbc0000gn/T/tmpico33e5u.sql:30:3

   |
42 |   ROUDN(ms.revenue / ms.order_count, 2) AS avg_order
   |   ^~~~~
   = help: did you mean 'round'?
```

### sqlite3

Runtime execution — stops at first error:

```text
Error: in prepare, table monthly_stats has 2 values for 3 columns
```

### sqlite-runner-lsp

Runtime via LSP — wraps sqlite3, same single error:

```text
(no diagnostics)
```

### sql-lint

Structural checks only:

```text

## Per-case error detection

# LSP details

## Tested capabilities

Each server is started, sent a test file, and probed for completion, hover,
diagnostics, and formatting via the LSP protocol.

| Feature                |    syntaqlite   |     sqls ¹    | sql-language-server |
| ---------------------- | :-------------: | :-----------: | :-----------------: |
| Completion             | Yes (129 items) | Yes (6 items) |   Yes (11 items)    |
| Hover                  |       No        |      Yes      |         No          |
| Go to definition       |       Yes       |      Yes      |         No          |
| Find references        |       Yes       |      No       |         No          |
| Diagnostics: syntax    |       Yes       |      No       |         Yes         |
| Diagnostics: semantic  |       Yes       |      No       |   No (style only)   |
| Formatting             |       Yes       |      Yes      |         No          |
| Rename                 |       Yes       |      Yes      |         Yes         |
| Signature help         |       Yes       |      Yes      |         No          |
| Requires DB connection |       No        |      Yes      |         No          |

¹ sqls requires a live database connection. Completion and hover results come
from the connected database schema, not static analysis. Without a database,
these features return no results.

### Completion depth

| Tool                | Items                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| syntaqlite          | 129 ████████████████████ |
| sql-language-server | 11 █                     |
| sqls ¹              | 6 █                      |

## Diagnostic detail

What each server reports for `SELEC * FROM users;` (syntax error):

### syntaqlite

```text
1:1 error syntax error near 'SELEC'
```

### sqls

```text
(no diagnostics)
```

### sql-language-server

```text
1:2 error Expected "$", "(", "--", "/*", "ALTER", "CREATE TABLE", "CREATE", "DELETE", "DROP TABLE", "DROP VIEW", "DROP", "INSERT", "REPLACE", "SELECT", "UPDATE", "WITH", "return", [ \t\n\r], or end of input but "S" found.
```
